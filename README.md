# Robot-Control-Card-Software
## Overview
Welcome to the source code repository for the Motor Control Card of our autonomous robot, designed and developed by the Clubelek Association. This control card is a critical component of our robot's system, handling motor regulation, odometry, and localization. The software running on this card ensures precise control of the robot's movement and accurate tracking of its position, which is essential for autonomous navigation.

## Features
Motor Regulation: Smooth and efficient control of motor speed and direction to ensure precise movement of the robot.
Odometry Calculation: Real-time computation of the robot's position and orientation based on wheel encoder data.
Localization: Integration with other sensors (if applicable) for accurate positioning within the environment.
PID Control: Implementation of PID algorithms for precise motor control and trajectory correction.
Modular Design: The software is designed to be easily extendable and modifiable to accommodate additional features or different robot configurations.
